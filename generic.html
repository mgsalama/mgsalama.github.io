									<h1>About Me</h1>
								</header>
								<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/manaar-salama.JPG"/></span> Hello there! My name is Manaar Salama (she/her/hers). I'm an undergraduate senior at University of California, Berkeley majoring in Data Science and minoring in Chinese.</p>
								<p>Before coming to UC Berkeley, I knew that I wanted to find a major and career path in which the work I did could benefit the people and world around me. I really enjoyed statistics but had never coded before, yet I was really drawn to computer science. After taking my first data science courses at Cal, I was interested in the ability to combine working with data and writing code, and I was especially impressed when I saw just how useful data science could be in many different industries. I had found the major for me!</p>
								<p>My specialization for my major is in economics, and much of the experience I have had through internships and personal projects has been working with data about products and appointments, content performance, and transaction information. I thoroughly enjoy being able to find trends and patterns in things I come across daily. My main goal for my career is to be able to work for a company or organization with values I truly stand by and projects where I can be curious and learn about something every day!</p>
								<p>Aside from my interest in data science, I am also studying Chinese at Cal and really enjoy learning new languages. I also aim to continue self-learning more computer science and software engineering fundamentals after graduation in order to expand my skill set. In my free time, I enjoy reading, shooting hoops with my partner at the park, and creating video content on YouTube for fun.</p>
