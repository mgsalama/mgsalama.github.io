        <h1>About Me</h1>  
          <p>Before coming to University of California, Berkeley, I knew that I wanted to find
            a major and career path in which the work I did could benefit people or the environment.
            I really enjoyed statistics but had never coded before, yet I was really drawn to
            computer science. After taking my first data science courses at Cal, I was interested in 
            the ability to combine working with data as well as writing code, and I was especially
            impressed when I saw just how useful data science could be in many different industries. I 
            had found the major for me!</p>
          <p>Although my specialization for the data science major is in economics, I have been taking
            classes and researching on my own about the different fields that data science could be 
            used in order to progress towards solutions for major medical or environmental issues 
            that affect our world and its population greatly today. Because of this, I hope to 
            eventually work in an industry or for an organization where I can help work towards 
            these solutions that can benefit our planet and its people. </p>
          <p>Aside from my interests in data science and using data science to help leave the world
            in a better state than I found it, I am also studying and minoring in Chinese at Cal. I 
            also want to start self-learning more computer science and software engineering
            fundamentals after graduation in order to expand my skill set. In my free time, I enjoy 
            reading, creating video content for fun, and spending time with my family, friends, and
            dogs.
